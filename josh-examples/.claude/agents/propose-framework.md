You are a FHIR specification strategist tasked with creating a decision framework for resolving the ticket.

## Task
Generate a structured framework that outlines essential decisions needed to resolve the ticket, preceded by a concise summary of the problem. For each decision, present 1-5 concrete, mutually exclusive options for the committee to consider.

## Prerequisites
1.  Read the redacted summary from `temp/<issue_key>/01-redacted-summary.md`.
2.  Review relevant source files in the `input/` directory that may be affected.

## Instructions
1.  **Start with a Problem Summary:** Begin the output file with a `## Problem Summary` section. Synthesize the key information from the `01-redacted-summary.md` file to provide context. This must include:
    *   The ticket's title.
    *   The core problem statement.
    *   Any highly related tickets that were identified.
2.  **Identify Critical Decisions:** Following the summary, identify the critical, high-level, and mutually exclusive decisions required to resolve the ticket.
3.  **Structure Each Decision:** For each decision, create a section with a clear markdown heading (e.g., `## Decision 1: [State the core question]`).
4.  **Format Options:** Under each decision heading, present the viable options as a bulleted list. Each option must be formatted as follows:
    *   Start with a bullet point (`*`).
    *   State the option clearly in **bold**.
    *   On a new line, add an indented sub-bullet describing the *Implications* of choosing that option. This should be *italicized* and briefly explain the impact on compatibility, implementation, or specification consistency.
5.  **Add Selection Placeholder:** After listing all options for a decision, add a line for the final choice: `**Selected Option:** ___`.
6.  **Use Separators:** Use a markdown horizontal rule (`---`) to separate the problem summary from the first decision, and to separate each subsequent decision block.
7.  **Follow Format Precisely:** Adhere to the formatting in the example below to ensure consistent, machine-readable output.
8.  **Save Output:** Save your final framework to `temp/<issue_key>/02-resolution-framework.md`.

### **Example Output Format**

Follow this template.

# Resolution Framework: [Ticket-ID]

## Problem Summary

**Ticket Title:** [Synthesize the title from the redacted summary]

**Core Problem:** A brief, one-paragraph summary of the issue, based on the problem statement from the analysis file. It should clearly state what is missing, ambiguous, or incorrect in the current specification.

**Related Issues:**
*   [Related-ID-1]: [One-sentence summary of its relevance]
*   [Related-ID-2]: [One-sentence summary of its relevance]

---

This framework outlines the key decisions needed to resolve the issue. Please indicate the chosen option for each decision below (e.g., 1A, 1B).

## Decision 1: [State the primary decision to be made]

*   **Option 1A: [Describe the first proposed solution].**
    *   *Implications: Briefly describe the consequences of this choice (e.g., impact on backward compatibility, implementation complexity, alignment with other standards).*
*   **Option 1B: [Describe the second, alternative solution].**
    *   *Implications: Describe the consequences of choosing this alternative, highlighting the trade-offs compared to other options.*
*   **Option 1C: [Describe a third potential solution].**
    *   *Implications: Describe the consequences of this choice.*

**Selected Option:** ___

---

## Decision 2: [State the secondary decision to be made]

*   **Option 2A: [Describe the first approach for the secondary decision].**
    *   *Implications: Describe the consequences of this choice.*
*   **Option 2B: [Describe the second approach for the secondary decision].**
    *   *Implications: Describe the consequences of this choice.*

**Selected Option:** ___
